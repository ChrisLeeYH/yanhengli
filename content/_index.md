      title: 'üìö My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am currently working on social media + HCI, applying observational study and quantitative methods. I fortunately have a first-author CSCW 2025 paper on voter-fraud misinformation in the 2024 Taiwan presidential election, and a CIKM 2025 co-author paper analyzing LLMs for peer review. 

        My previous researches use human-in-the-loop and LLM-assisted pipelines to study YouTube media ecosystems, including amplifier behaviors in comment networks of 11k+ videos and 460k+ comments under political crisis (manuscript submitted), and misinformation in election contexts of 5k+ videos with multimodal analysis (forthcoming in CSCW 25).  I am also working on projects on LLM-based visual analysis for media images and TikTok ‚Äúrefugee‚Äù discourse on RedNote.

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into academic peer review, prompting debates between full automation and purely human evaluation. Emerging evidence suggests optimal peer review leverages both human expertise and AI capabilities, and several major conferences have already adopted AI-assisted reviewing practices. However, effectively integrating these reviewers requires an aspect-based understanding of LLM vulnerabilities, clearly identifying specific dimensions where AI is most prone to error. Prior studies broadly caution against LLM biases but lack precise, aspect-specific insights necessary for informed human-AI partnerships in peer-review processes. We propose an aspect-guided, multi-level perturbation framework to systematically diagnose LLM weaknesses in automated peer review. By introducing targeted perturbations across key review components (papers, reviews, rebuttals) and evaluating impacts along critical quality dimensions (contribution, soundness, presentation, tone, completeness), our framework functions as a diagnostic tool: deviations from expected rating shifts after perturbation directly reveal specific LLM vulnerabilities. Our empirical analyses uncover recurring weaknesses, including misclassification of methodological flaws, disproportionate influence of strong rejection recommendations, inadequate responses to incomplete or negatively toned rebuttals, and misinterpretation of incorrect critiques as rigorous evaluations. These vulnerabilities consistently persist across diverse prompting strategies and a broad set of widely-used LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, LLaMA 3). This diagnostic framework provides granular insights into LLM limitations, empowering conference organizers to establish pragmatic, aspect-specific guidelines and enabling balanced, informed, and robust peer-review practices.},

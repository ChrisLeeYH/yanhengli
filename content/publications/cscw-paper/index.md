abstract: This paper presents a mixed-method analysis of voter fraud misinformation on YouTube during Taiwanâ€™s 2024 election. Using a computational pipeline and manual coding, we identify videos discussing ballot-related fraud claims. Our findings show that Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-aligned accounts produced the most such content, which drew more comments but fewer likes than other videos. Case studies reveal distinct strategies: some media outlets and grassroots accounts promoted fraud claims, while DPP-linked channels often refuted them. This study sheds light on the dynamics of multi-modal voter fraud misinformation in Taiwan and informs global efforts to mitigate its spread.
